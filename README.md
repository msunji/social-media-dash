## Overview

For this challenge, user's need to be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

Here's how the project looks like on desktop:

And mobile:

I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to get more familiar with styled-components and theming. I learned a bit more about using the `ThemeProvider` wrapper component.

## Built with

- React (Bootstrapped with CRA)
